# vBulletin Jabber Integration
As Internet Brands still hasn't been able to integrate Jabber as normal IM Field, I made my own hack.

This Add-On integrates an IM Field for Jabber. It allows users to send Jabber Messages and can send Birthday wishes via Jabber, if the JID has been entered by the user. New post, thread and PM notifications, are integrated too, duuh!

In future we plan seperate Setting for Jabber and email.

The PHP code changes in codechanges.txt are optional and is not required for running this hack.

Included Language Files (extras/languagefiles):

* German
* English
* Russian

Thank you to flosoft for the English Translation and zCarot for the Russian Translation.

For Auto-Template Changes you need the Template Modification System from Andreas. If is this not installed, read the templateedits-enhanced_jabber.txt for Template Changes.
